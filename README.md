# Fake-News-Detection
This is fake news detection project,In this I used Django as a framework and PostgreSQL as Database. 
Here in this project the User and the Employer login will display in the home page, the work of the Employer is to collect news from any where and add it to the database by submitting a news after login. The login credentials are provided by the admin. Where as the user will get into the website and login if already existing user otherise create their account by registering themself. Search the news they want to know, it will display the news as Real if it is found in the databse otherwise it will display as fake news and it will suggest from wikipedia and from Google.
Run the code from Command Prompt by entering manage.py runserver
